# Ben Mulholland Portfolio
* thank you for taking the time to look at the readme for the 3rd version of my portfolio

## notes
* all content is the creation of myself with the exception of PokeWeatherApp and Pandemic Portal that were group projects.  

* a lot of searching went into finding a nice template, then I gave up on trying to use all of those and kept playing with Css.  my next iteration will have an interactive element using js somewhere on the contact page.

* Phone number is not provided.

* all audio are protected under copywright, please ask permission before usage.

## Thanks!

* If you see any glaring ommissions or errors please reach out to me, feedback is always a gift and I look forward to learning from others.
